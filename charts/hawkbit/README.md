# Hawkbit Update Server

## Introduction

[Eclipse hawkBitâ„¢](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/) is a domain independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking infrastructure.
